# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship

## Overview
Welcome to the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship repository. This internship provides hands-on experience in data analysis within the retail sector, focusing on transactional and customer data to derive insights and make data-driven recommendations.


## Project Structure  
1. **Data Files:**
   - `QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv`: Contains customer purchase behavior data.
   - `QVI_transaction_data.xlsx`: Includes transactional data.  
   
2. **Scripts:**
   - `Task_1_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for cleaning and preparing data.
   - `Task_2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for exploratory data analysis and metrics calculation.
   - `Task_3_Comparison_and_Insights.ipynb`: Notebook for comparing trial and control stores and deriving insights.

3. **Output:**
   - `Task_3_Insights.pdf`: PDF report summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations.

## Tasks Completed
- **Task 1: Data Cleaning**
  - Cleaned and preprocessed raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
  
- **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Calculated metrics such as total sales, customer count, and average transaction value.
  - Visualized data using charts and graphs to identify trends and patterns.

- **Task 3: Comparison and Insights**
  - Selected control stores based on Pearson correlation.
  - Compared trial and control stores during the trial period.
  - Derived insights on sales performance and customer behavior.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python environment is set up with required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
2. Open each Jupyter notebook (`*.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion
This internship provided valuable experience in data analytics, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to deriving actionable insights. The findings and recommendations aim to support strategic decision-making in retail operations.
